# MODULE 9 (Full Stack Frameworks With Django) PROJECT 
# Code Institute Full Stack Developer Diploma
# E-Commerce Website (Artefact Sales)

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/keefm6776/ij-artefact-sales-site.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/keefm6776/ij-artefact-sales-site)

## Project purpose:

In this project, you'll build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a 
centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access 
to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of an 
artefact/service.

Value provided: By authenticating on the site and paying for some of its services, users can 
advance their own goals. Before authenticating, the site makes it clear how those goals would 
be furthered by the site.

The site owner is able to make money by providing this set of services to the users. There is 
no way for a regular user to bypass the site's mechanisms and derive all of the value available 
to paid users without paying.

## BRIEF (CHOSEN PROJECT)

Build an auction place to sell historical artifacts, with the following goals:

1.  External userâ€™s goal:   Find, learn about and acquire artefacts they are interested in.

2.  Site owner's goal:      Earn money on selling the artifacts (the site owner is the seller)
    Potential features to include:

    * Create an online store focused on selling unique historical artefacts,
        such as The Holy Grail to the highest bidder.

    * Allow users to search for artefacts based on various fields.

3.  Allow users to see the price, image and other basic details about an artefact.

4.  Users would be able to learn about the historical details of each artifact,
    the culture it came from, the way it was created and its journey across different
    owners in the past.

    For example, you might want to include information about "events" that took place
    in the past and that one or more artifacts took place in, or originated from.

5.  Allow users to bid on items, or pay a higher price to purchase them immediately.
    Users have to be registered for this.

## Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)

1.  Allow registered users to write reviews about the artefacts, only if they purchased them.

2.  Expand the search functionality to allow users to sort results based on price,
    age and other parameters in both ascending and descending order.

3.  Include pagination and/or other dynamic display actions using javascript.

4.  Use javascript polling to update the page whenever there's a new bid.

# CHOSEN PROJECT

## User Stories

Before Starting, I started to create some user stories:

1.	As a User I want to be able to search for artefacts that interest me, by their name or
    a particular era in history.

2.  As a User I want to be able to view the artefacts information including description,
    history and what era it is from.

3.	As a User I want to be able to purchase the artefact if I like it, or leave a bid
    if I am not willing to pay the price asked.

4.  As a User if I buy an artefact or have a bid accepted, I want to have it delivered to available
    to have it delivered to an address of my choosing.

5.  As the site's owner I want to be able to manage the items on the site, adding them as
    they become available to me and to mark them as sold when they sell.

6.  As the site's owner I want to be able to accept a bid that I deem acceptable for the item.

## Database Design

Before starting this project, I researched various e-commerce websites that are on the web, 
as mentioned in Credits -> Content, Below. I then set about drawing up a database schema for 
a relational database as per the project requirements.

Reference Diagrams in Database & UI Design Folder:

* Database Schema.pdf
* Overview Of Database.pdf

## UX

As part of the development process I mocked up wireframes of my recipe site before starting:

Which are located in the Database & UI Design Folder.

## Features

**Authentification:**

1. Any User Must Register and Create a Customer Profile to be able to use the site.
            
2. This Customer Profile is used to prepopulate the checkout information, to help make the process easier for the User, all they have to do then is to provide payment details.  If they wish to have the item delivered to someone else, then they must provide these details here.  Due to the value of these artefacts, they must be delivered to the billing address used for payment.

**Buyer (Once Logged In):**

3. The buyer is presented with the artefacts that are currently for sale, newest first, so that he/she can view an image of the artefact, read up on its history and read any other description that the seller has provided.

4. There is a search bar to be able to filter the artefacts by:
    * Name
    * A range of centuries
    * The era of the item (ie BC or AD)
            
5. On each artefact panel there is:
    * The option to add the artefact to the cart.
    * Read more, which presents the history and description of the item to the user.
    * Go to the bidding page for this item.

6. A link to the cart: 
            
    a) Once in the cart:
    * They can view the items that they have added to the cart.
    * For Each Item they can set the required number back to zero, removing it from the cart.
    * They can still re-read the history/description of the item.
    * They can choose to checkout their selected artefacts.

    b) Once having chosen the checkout:
    * They can check their contact/billing details are correct, or recitfy them
    * Provide the card number that they wish to pay with, but it must be the billing address of the card, as the details entered are sent to Stripe.
    * On having paid for the artefact(s), they are returned to the list of artefacts that are still for sale.  (The ones that have just been bought are marked as sold)

7.  A link to the logged in customer's profile: 
    * This allows the User to adjust their customer contact details that are used to pre-prepopulate the checkout details.

8.  The Link to Log out:
    * This allows the user to log out of their user area.
            

**Seller (Once Logged In):**
    
9.  Along the top menu the seller is able to filter the artefacts as to their current status:
        
    a)  For Sale, the seller (as default) is presented with the artefacts that are currently for sale, newest first, so that he/she can manipulate this data:

    * The seller can read the information that he/she has provided for the artefact.  
    * The seller can edit the information that he/she has provided for the artefact.  
    * The seller can delete the artefact from the database
            
    b) Sold, the seller is presented with the artefacts that are sold, newest first, however they are now unable to edit and delete the information about the artefact:

    * The seller can search these sold items as per feature 4.
    * The Seller can still read the information that they have provided for the artefact.
    * The seller can click the despatch button, this will provide them with a pdf of a despatch note and make the artefact as despatched.

    c) Despatched, the seller is presented with the artefacts that are despatched, newest first, however they are now unable to edit and delete the information about the artefact:

    * The seller can search these despatched items as per feature 4.
    * The Seller can still read the information that they have provided for the artefact.

      NB.  Each of the above three operations are only available while the artefact is still for sale.

10. Also on the top menu is add, this when clicked presents the seller with a form that enables them to create a new artefact and all the information that can be provided.

11. The seller can edit their own profile with the link provided to the right of the top navbar.

12. The seller can logout with the link provided to the right of the navbar.



## Features Left To Implement

1. Bid Acceptance  -   I have the functionality of a bid process for each artefact so that the user can bid on each one (once logged in), or buy the artefact at the advertised price.  It still remains to implement a feature for a staff user to be able to accept a bid from a given user, and remove the item from sale, instead of that user paying full price.

## Technologies Used

1. GITPOD	        -   All the HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT/PYTHON was edited using GITPOD.

2. HTML 5 		    -   The structure of the page has been created in HTML5.

3. CSS 3	        -   The pages were styled using SS3.

4. FONT AWESOME    -   Font Awesome was used to provide the icons throughout the project, as required.

5. JAVASCRIPT      -   Javascript used to provide an exit button on various forms where I found it frustrating not to have one.  Javascript also provided the functionality of stripe payments which are run using it.

6. DJANGO          -   Django was used to provide:

    a) The security and feature of logging in and logging out from the site.  
    
    b) Django has allowed me to allocate users different status depending on who they are. i.e.
   * Superuser - I am the superuser who can access the admin panel and has access to the backend.
   * Staff     - This is the site owner, who is granted functionality related to listing and selling items.
   * User      - This is the default level, which all customers are given    
                                                            They are only able to see, buy or bid the artefacts and
                                                            are not able to upload artefacts or make changes to them.

    c) The admin panel which allowed me to view and edit models etc.
    
    d) Testing suite to be able to run test on the forms, views and models to endhance the manual testing that I would have completed whilst developing

7.	BOOTSTRAP       -	I used Bootstrap to enhance the base HTML for my site, this allowed me to have  extras when developing.  I was provided with:
                                        
    * Navbar and responsiveness between large and small devices.
    * The pagination for listing pages.  
    * The grid feature for responsiveness between screen sizes.
    * Positional commands to allow easy centering of divs and menus, as well as being able to position them to the left and right.

8. POSTGRES         -   Postgres (via Heroku) as the relational databse to keep all the information required for this project to run and provide all the functionailty of an SQL database.
            
9. SQL LITE 3		-	SQL Lite 3 was a backup SQL database that would be used in the event of POSTGRES not being available.  This became invaluable to me while testing with Django, because I was unable to connect to postgres at that time.

10.  GOOGLE CHROME DEVELOPER TOOLS -   Used To Test While Developing, checking output and values during processing. Testing Functions during development, general tesing of website responsiveness

11. GIT/GITHUB		-	Used for version control with regular commits.

12. HEROKU          -   Used to deploy the project.

13. TRAVIS CI       -   Travis Continuous Integration (CI) testing.  This maintained standards by running tests every time I pushed a new commit and reported the results to a pull request.
            
14. AWS S3 Bucket   -   This allowed me to store my static files in the cloud so that they were available to my site at all times.

15. weasyprint (HTML) - Enabled me to create the pdf file which was used as a despatch note for the artefact.

16. dillinger.io - This enabled me to write my readme file in markdown, and preview it whilst I was creating the file.  


## Git Commits

I have made regular Git Commits during my project for version control and also to allow myself to go back if anything went wrong. I have pushed each of these commits to GitHub, so that the progress of my project can be reviewed. I folowed the steps provided by the GitHub site, which were:

1.	I set up a page in GITPOD

2.	In the terminal I typed "git init", to initialise the repository
			
3.	To add files to be committed, I typed "git add ."
			
4.  To check that these files were staged, I typed "git status" (staged files should be in green font)
			
5.	To commit these to git, the command "git commit -m "messsage"", was used.  With a meaningful message about the commit inside the "".
			
6.	To link the my github account, I used the following: git remote add origin https://github.com/keefm6776/ij-artefact-sales-site.git
			
7.	To push each commit to github I used : git push -u origin master.  Each time a new version was committed to github, Travis-CI would run the required tests on the new version.
			
8.	For each subsequent commit I repeated steps 3, 4, 5 & 7.

## Static Files

I used AWS buckets to store static files.  This includes:

1.  My custom css file.
2.  Images uploaded to display with the artefacts.
3.  Javascript for Stripe and my custom javascript.
4.  Font-Awesome CSS and Font Files.

To create a bucket, I had to:

1.  Create an account with aws.amazon.com.
2.  In the find services search box, I searched for S3 (Scalable storage in the cloud)
3.  Once in S3 buckets I clicked the blue "Create Bucket" Button.
4.  I gave my bucket a unique name and selected the region closest to me ie EU (Ireland), and clieked next.
5.  On the next page as there is nothing that I needed to change, so I just clicked next.
6.  On this page I unchecked the "Block all public access" option and clicked next.
7.  I then clicked create bucket.

Once the bucket was created:

1.  I opened the bucket by clicking on its name.
2.  I selected the Properties tab.
3.  I then cliked on Static Website Hosting, and selected "Use this bucket to host a website"
4.  I then entered "index.html" and "error.html" for the index and error documnets respectively.
5.  Now I saved this information.
6.  Next I selected the permissions tab, and then the "CORS configuration" button.
7.  I then copied and pasted the provided configuration into the editor, ie:
    
    CORS Configuration
    <CORSConfiguration>
    <CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
    <AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
    </CORSConfiguration>

8.  Then I selected "bucket policy" and copied and pasted the provided policy into the editor, ie:

    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::ij-artefact-sales/*"
        }
    ]
}

    However, the "Resource": information was copied and pasted from above the editor where my ARN was displayed. Leaving the '/*' at the end of the ARN.

9.  After this, I cliked "save" to save all this information.
10. Once the bucket information was saved I went back to the main AWS page and searched for 'IAM'
11. Once in IAM I selected the Groups option from the Left hand menu, and selected the blue "Create Group" button.
12. For step one, I gave my group a relevant name, ie 'ij-artefact-sales-group'.
13. For step two, I just clicked the 'next' button.
14. For step three, I just clicked the 'create group' button.
15. Next I clicked 'policies' from the left hand menu, and then selected the 'JSON' tab.
16. Next I clikced the 'import managed policy' link at the top right of the editor.
17. I searched for S3 and selected the 'AmazonS3FullAccess' policy.
18. This inputted a generic policy and I replace the "*" for "Resource" with a list, which was 
    my ARN from before followed by a comma, then this ARN again followed by '/*' ie [ARN, ARN/*]
19. I then clicked the 'Review Policy' Button, and gave it a name associated with my bucket, ie 'ij-artefact-sales-policy', followed by clicking the 'create policy' button.
20. I then went back to the group that I created earlier, so I selected 'Groups' from the left hand menu,
    and selected the 'ij-artefact-sales-group' link.
21. I then selected the 'Permissions' tab, clicked 'attach a policy'
22. I then searched for the 'ij-artefact-sales-policy' that I created, checked it and clicked 'attach policy'
23. This now meant that I could create a user, by selecting 'Users' from the left hand menu.
24. Again, I gave a relevant name, ie 'ij-artefact-sales-user' and checked the 'Programmatic access' option.
25. I then clicked the 'Next: Permissions' button, and selected my group ie 'ij-artefact-sales-group' and clicked the 'Next:tags' button
26. No keys were required so I clicked the 'Next: Review' button, followed by the 'create user' button on the next screen.
27. I then clicked the 'Download .csv' button.










## Deployment

I used Heroku to deploy this project by following the steps provided in the CodeInstitute course. 
To initialise heroku, these were:

1.	Create an app in heroku, which has an unique name. In my case ijones-artefact-sales
			
2.	Next login to heroku through the CLI, using the 'heroku login' and entering your heroku credentials.
			
3.  To link heroku to the git repository I used the following: 'heroku git:remote -a ijones-artefact-sales
			
4.	I then sent the command to get it up and running : heroku ps:scale web=1 For this project

In Heroku, I then set the following Config Variables:

1.	PORT = 5000
2.  IP   = 0.0.0.0

Along with:

3.  STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE Key
4.  STRIPE_SECRET Key
5.  DATABASE_URL for postgres
6.  SECRET_KEY
7.  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       -   For S3 Bucket
8.  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   -   For S3 Bucket

Also in Heroku I have set up the deployment method o be done via GitHub, and enabled automtic deployments when a new version is pushed to the master branch.  However deployment will not go ahead until the Travis-CI tests have passed.
            
I have also a local copy of these in a file called env.py, which is not being committed to Git/Github that allows me to run my project locally.

I was then able to open the app, using the Open App button in Heroku.

Before the final deployment of this project, I have set the debug variable to false in settings.py.

This project has been deployed via Heroku at : https://ijones-artefact-sales.herokuapp.com/

My Site Files and other supporting Files can be found at: https://github.com/keefm6776/ij-artefact-sales-site

## Testing
Each new feature had been tested after each stage of development within the GITPOD environment. This has included:

**Manual Testing:**

I have used the site completing each path that can be followed by a user throught the cart and 
checkout and I have also manually tested each link on the site.

**Automated Testing:**

Using Travis-ci:

By linking my GitHub reppository for this project to travis-ci.org, I have been able to check out 
the relevant branch and run the commands specified in .travis.yml, building the software and running
any automated tests.

Using the Django testing suite I have:

1. Tested the forms in each app, where applicable, to make sure that the form is not valid if is has incomplete data.  I did this by testing each required field to make sure that this was the case. See test_forms.py in each app, where applicable.
    
2. Tested the models in each app, where applicable, to make sure that the model information is the same after being passed throuogh.  I did this by testing each field to make sure that information from the model was the same when accessing it with the test_delivery_full_name.delivery_full_name format.  

    **NB.**  I was unable to complete these tests when the was an id or an instance involved.  However in addition to any automated testing I have also checked these links etc manually.  So these instances where I have been unable to test automatically I have already done so manually.
    
3.  Tested the views in each app, to make sure that the form is not valid if is has incomplete data.  I did this by testing each required field to make sure that this was the case. See test_forms.py in each app, where applicable.
    
After deployment the site has been tested for the above on:

1.	iPhone 7s on portrait screen (iOS 12 - Safari).
	
2.	iPhone 7s on landscape screen. (iOS 12 - Safari)
	
3.	iPad Air 2 on portrait screen. (iOS 12 - Safari)
	
4.	iPad Air 2 on landscape screen. (iOS 12 - Safari)

5.  Samsung Galaxy s9 on portrait screen. (Android 8.0.0 (Oreo) - Samsung Internet)
	
6.  Samsung Galaxy s9 on landscape screen. (Android 8.0.0 - (Oreo) - Samsung Internet)
	
7. 	Hanns-G 20" widescreen monitor. 
    
I have covered all the main browsers on the Windows 10 platform with this testing.  Namely:

* Google Chrome 74.0.3729.108, 
* Firefox 66.0.3, 
* MS Edge 42.17134.1.0, 
* Opera 60.0.3255.56

I have found that they were all responsive to orientation when applicable, and the site ran as expected in all these scenarios. 

I was unable to test Internet Explorer because it would not run on my Windows 10 computer, but I am not particularly concerned as this has a very low market share from between 3-4% from the stats quoted on Wikipedia. At this stage this share would only be decreasing with desktop computers being on the decline and Windows 10 taking over this market with MS Edge.

## Resolved Issues:

**Travis CI testing:**

1. I managed to rectify any early setting errors with the use of Travis.  After this the only error was a repeated one, where I had forgotten to comment out the "import env" statement.
    
**Manual Testing:**

1.  I found no padding on the response banner, meaning that it was on top of the register and log in buttons.  Also around the writing that "Indy is retiring", required padding.

2.  I found that in the Staff log in, when filtering artefact for sale, sold and despatched there was no title to confirm this was the filter that was applied for the user. I have now added able title in to indicate which filter is being used.

3.  I found that the highest bid dislayed in the Bids page, was not specific to the artefact that you had clicked to bid on.  In fact I had returned to highest bid in the database.  I then filtered the artefacts with the artefact id that was given by clicking on the artefact that the user wished to bid on.  Furthermore I managed to filter the current customer so only their highest bid for the artefact was displayed, I then realise this error and removed the customer id filter.

4. I found that Artefacts were not ordered, potentially giving inconsistent results/ordering when displaying artefact records.  This was flagged by the use of pagination on the listing of the artefacts, so I added .order_by('-id') so that it would order the artefacts so that the newest id would be shown first.
        
5. On testing my checkout view, I found out that when I linked the order to the customer object, I declared it as customer, which had already been used in the stripe code.  I then change my customer object to customer_object.

6. On small screens the hidden menu was not listing the items in the menu, however this is now rectified.

7. On small screens the search banner was too big, so I have re-ordered the fields in it and changed CSS to make it more suitable.

8. Also on small screens flexbox made the width of the display container for each artefact too narrow so I added a mixin, to make this wider on the smallest screens.
        
9. On the profile page, the "You are logged in as:" line was too big, mainly on smaller screens, I have changed this to a more appropriate size.  Also the fields were not centred, so I have used bootstrap to achieve this.

10. I found that when there was no image reference in the database that as you would expect, there was no image shown when the artefact was listed.  When this occurs I have displayed a default image, so that there is an image displyed to match the other listings.
         
11. Payments - I have tested my payments with Stripe using the following details:

    * Card No:        4242 4242 4242 4242
    * CCV:            123                     (any three digits)
    * Expiry Date:    01/2020                 (any date in the future)
    

**Automated Testing:**
    
1. Testing with the django test suite I found that a customer information could be added even if it was blank.  I have added the 'blank=False' clause to prevent this from happening again, so the test would pass. 
        
        
## Unresolved Issues:

**Manual Testing:**

1. Any artefact can be added via the admin panel or by a staff user via the app.  However when using the app I had to remove the image field from the addition because this was causing an error and was not uploading the image.  I have had assitance from a few tutors and was unable to find why this did not upload the file to my S3 bucket, especially considering it worked 
correctly from the admin panel.  This has meant that I have added the default site image to add as the image for any artefact that has been added via the app that has not image.
        
2. On small screens, the artefact listings are very narrow.  I tried a number of ways to recitfy this but was unable to do so in a satidfactory way.


## Examination

For the purpose of examination I have created the following user, which had staff status and allows the examier to see the sellers area, allowing the functionality mention above:

* Username :  examiner
* Password :  #letmecheck

Naturally, you can register yourself as a User to check the selling end of the site.

## Code Validation:

I have validated my site with W3C validation tools:

1. For HTML, I have managed to eliminate any errors in the validation tool, with the exception of Errors arising from:

    * Extending base.html (ie no DOCTYPE or language declaration etc)
    * Use of templating syntax.

2. For CSS, I have managed to eliminate any validation errors in my CSS as per the validation tool.


## Content
Before starting this project I looked at various selling based sites, to get a flavour of what is required, these included:

1. Ebay.ie
2. Amazon.co.uk
3. Littlewoodsireland.ie
4. Argos.ie

I obtained the sample artefacts for my site from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
